# Manual cloning

It is also possible to use the dapp boilerplate via manually cloning the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:paltalabs/create-soroban-dapp.git`

The dapp will then not be in the root folder, this folder is occupied by the npx script. You will find the dapp in the sub folder 'soroban-react-dapp':

`cd soroban-react-dapp`

From there, it is a normal nextjs app:

`yarn` or `npm install` or `pnpm install`

> Note: Using this technique you will clone also the npx script which will be of no use for you. You can only keep the subfolder `soroban-dapp` containing the nextjs project.
