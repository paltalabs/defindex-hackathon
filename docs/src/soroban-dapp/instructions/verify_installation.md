# Verify Installation

## Run the app on a local server

To verify that everything is in order, open a shell in the nextjs soroban-dapp folder, and run

```bash
# If you use yarn
yarn dev

# If you use npm or pnpm
npm run dev
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the development server. The dapp will be available on localhost. 

The dapp should display the current greeting set in the testnet smart contract. 

> If you encounter an error, make sure you have [installed the dependencies](../../create-soroban-dapp/getting_started.md) of the project!

## Try the dapp

`Connect your wallet and check if you can interact with the dapp by sending a new greeting!` 

> You may need some tokens from the faucet to interact with the testnet.<br/><br/>
