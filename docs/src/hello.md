# A script and a boilerplate

@create-soroban-dapp is both a [npx script](./create-soroban-dapp/overview.md) and a [boilerplate dapp](./soroban-dapp/overview.md) for kickstarting any of your ideas for a Soroban-based Dapp.

Largely inspired by the [ink!athon](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon) project by [Scio Labs](https://github.com/scio-labs) and by [@create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) by [T3 Open Source](https://github.com/t3-oss) for the script mechanisms.

Check the [`LIVE VERSION`](https://create-soroban-dapp.vercel.app/) of the dapp utilizing already deployed testnet contract!

## Structure

`@create-soroban-dapp` is composed of two things:

- A boilerplate dapp utilizing the [@soroban-react](https://github.com/paltalabs/soroban-react).

- A npx script allowing any developer to quickstart its project via the command line and `npx create-soroban-dapp`. Using the script will help them set up the boilerplate dapp.
