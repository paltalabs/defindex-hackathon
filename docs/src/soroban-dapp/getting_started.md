## Getting started

> If it's not done already, you will need first to run the [create-soroban-dapp script](../create-soroban-dapp/getting_started.md).<br/><br/>
> If you prefer it is also possible to [clone the boilerplate repo manually](../create-soroban-dapp/manual_cloning.md).<br/><br/>
> We now suppose you ran the initialization script and that you have a folder containing the soroban-dapp next.js project.
